# Academic Personal Website

This is a simple, clean, and academic-style personal website. It is designed to be easily customizable.

## How to Customize

1.  **Edit `index.html`**: Open the `index.html` file and replace the placeholder text (e.g., `[Your Name]`, `[Your University/Institution]`, etc.) with your own information.
2.  **Edit `css/style.css`**: If you want to change the visual style of the website (e.g., colors, fonts, etc.), you can edit the `css/style.css` file.
3.  **Add your own content**: You can add more sections to the `index.html` file as needed. For example, you could add a section for your research projects, teaching experience, or awards.
